boat-lifestyle clone assignment given by geekster. In this I have tried to clone the website within a day.

My task is that we have to create a consumer electronics brand the famous electronic e-commerce website boat-lifestyle clone with basic core functionalities and good looking user interface.

As we all know BoAt is an India-based consumer electronics brand established in 2015 that markets earphones, headphones stereos. BoAt is an Indian e-commerce company. It is India's fastest growing audio & wearables brand. The most incredible range of wireless earphones, earbuds, headphones, smart watches, and home audio. From workouts to adventures, boAt will get you sailing!...

BoAt brand is Indian, but its products, not so much. boAt's products are made through contract manufacturing in China, which is a reason why they are so affordable.
